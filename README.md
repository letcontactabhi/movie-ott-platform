# Movie-OTT Platform Database Project Summary

## Project Overview
Developed a web application that serves as a database linking movies to their availability on OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms, focusing on movies from Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu cinema.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js (App Router) for the full-stack React framework
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Axios for HTTP requests

## Key Components

### 1. Database Design
- Implemented a relational database schema using Prisma
- Created tables for Movies, OTT Platforms, and a junction table for Movie-OTT Platform links
- Established relationships between entities

### 2. Backend Development
- Set up API routes using Next.js App Router
- Implemented CRUD operations for movies and platforms
- Created an endpoint for linking movies to platforms
- Developed a search functionality for movies

### 3. Frontend Development
- Designed a user interface using React and shadcn/ui components
- Implemented forms for adding movies, platforms, and linking them
- Created a search interface for finding movies
- Displayed the list of movies with their OTT platform availability

### 4. Database Integration
- Successfully connected the application to a PostgreSQL database
- Used Prisma for database queries and schema management
- Implemented database migrations for schema updates

## Functionalities Implemented
1. Add new movies with details (title, year, language)
2. Add new OTT platforms
3. Link movies to one or more OTT platforms
4. Search for movies by title, language, or OTT platform
5. View a list of all movies with their OTT platform availability

## Development Process
1. Set up the Next.js project with App Router
2. Installed and configured Prisma for database management
3. Designed and implemented the database schema
4. Created API routes for backend functionality
5. Developed the frontend user interface
6. Integrated frontend with backend using Axios for API calls
7. Tested and debugged the application

## Challenges Overcome
- Successfully set up and connected to a PostgreSQL database
- Implemented a many-to-many relationship between movies and platforms
- Developed a search functionality that queries across related tables

## Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Enhance the UI/UX with more interactive elements
- Implement server-side rendering for improved performance

This project demonstrates a practical application of full-stack web development skills, including database design, API development, and frontend implementation, all centered around managing and querying a movie-OTT platform database.
